# 51% — 49%

In my early days as a software developer, I was deeply immersed in the world of coding. My daily routine revolved around Visual Studio, where I spent countless hours writing code. The satisfaction of solving complex problems through programming was unmatched. However, as I progressed in my career, I began to notice a significant shift in my perspective.

## The Turning Point

The turning point came when I started working on projects that required more than just technical excellence. I realized that while my code was functionally sound, the end-user experience wasn't always optimal. This revelation led me to explore the world of UX design.

### The Journey from Code to Design

1. **Initial Resistance**
   - Comfortable with coding
   - Skeptical about design's importance
   - Focused solely on functionality

2. **Gradual Awakening**
   - User feedback highlighting design issues
   - Recognition of design's impact on user satisfaction
   - Understanding the balance between functionality and usability

3. **The Transformation**
   - Learning design principles
   - Exploring UX tools like Figma
   - Bridging the gap between development and design

## Finding the Balance

Today, my work is split almost equally between development and design - hence the title "51% — 49%". This balance has proven crucial in creating products that are not only technically robust but also user-friendly.

### Key Learnings

1. **Technical Excellence Isn't Everything**
   - Good code alone doesn't guarantee user satisfaction
   - User experience can make or break a product
   - Design thinking enhances technical solutions

2. **The Power of Design Tools**
   - Figma as a game-changer
   - Prototyping before coding
   - Collaborative design processes

3. **Integration of Both Worlds**
   - Using developer knowledge to inform design decisions
   - Applying design thinking to code architecture
   - Creating more holistic solutions

## Conclusion

The journey from being a pure developer to embracing UX design has been transformative. While I still spend slightly more time in Visual Studio (the 51%), the time spent in Figma (the 49%) has become equally valuable. This balance has not only made me a better developer but also helped me create solutions that truly serve their purpose - helping users.
